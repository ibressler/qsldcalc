 * Validates alias names entered in the AliasNameDialog.
 * Since an alias \e simulates a single chemical element (which is defined by
 * a group of chemical elements), it must follow the naming convention for
 * chemical element symbol names: first letter in upper case and all following
 * letters in lower case which implies that it consists of alphabetical
 * letters only (no numbers, no special characters).
 * Example: \e Aaa, \e Tri, \e Gui, \e Gjkher allowed
