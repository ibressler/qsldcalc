/**
 * Contains all chemical elements currently known by this program. It
 * stores the alias names for element compounds separately because an
 * ordinary database element can not store the associated
 * cfp::Compound (for aliases). 
 *
 * The element datasets are not sorted in any way but can be retrieved
 * in constant time complexity.
 *
 * \todo Combine single chemical elements and aliases (cfp::Compound)
 * into a single data type. Pro: aliases could be easily visualized in
 * the same way as regular elements. Con: Additional (unused) data
 * fields for ordinary chemical elements (\b minor) and all the
 * properties of a single element have to be calculated for compounds
 * too: At alias creation time or at access time (\b major, regarding
 * visualization).
 *
 * \todo Add a preconfigured list of aliases, similar to
 * http://www.chemcalc.org .
 *
 * \todo Save user-defined aliases to a file in the users
 * home-directory to restore them after restart of the application.
